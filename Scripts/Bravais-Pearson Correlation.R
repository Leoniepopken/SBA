# Measurement of strength of linear relationship
# The closer the pairs (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖, 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖) are to a straight line with positive slope, the closer 𝑟 is to 1
# The closer the pairs (𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖, 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖) are to a straight line with negative slope, the closer 𝑟 is to -1
# !!Warning!! The Bravais-Pearson correlation coefficient captures only linear relationships
