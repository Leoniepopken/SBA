- The absolute frequency hij = h(ai, bj) of the combination (ai, bj), i = 1, … , k, j = 1, … , m, corresponds to the number of pairs(xi, yj) of the original list that match (ai, bj)
- Joint distributions =  values hij i = 1, … , k, j = 1, … , m
- the data on the joint absolute frequencies can be summarized in a contingency table:
```{r}
x <- matrix(c(1,4,7,4,0,8,9,4,6,3,2,2,5,7,5,6), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 4)
addmargins(x)
```
- the sum of the rows and columns are called the marginal absolute frequencies
- the same can be done with the relative frequencies, which can be calculated that way: fij = hij / n
- note that k is the number of rows and m is the number of columns
