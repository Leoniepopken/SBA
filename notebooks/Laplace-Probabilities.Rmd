##### Recap: [Random Events](./path/to/random/events)
- a collection of outcomes of a random trial is called *(random) event*.
- Events are **subsets of the sample space $\Omega$**

### Laplace experiments
- In a finitely sample space $\Omega$ with finitely many outcomes {$\omega_1,...,\omega_n$}
- A Laplace experiment is a random experiment in which all possible outcomes *have the same* probability.
- Examples:
  - Tossing a coin: $\Omega =$ {Head, Tail}.    probability: $\frac{1}{2}$


### Laplace probability
- Calculate the probability $P(A)$ of an event $A \subseteq \Omega$ as:
- $P(A) = \frac{\text{number of outcomes for which event A occurs}}{\text{number of all possible outcomes}} = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|}$
