**Recap: [Conditional probabilities](./path/to/contitinal/probs.html)**

Usually probabilities of events **may change** as we obtain *additional information about the occurence of other events*

> Sometimes the probability does not change despite such new information

In these cases we call the events A and B **stochastically independent**

## Stochastic independence

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
