- sxy <br>`1/n * (sum((x - mean(x)) * (y - mean(y))))`
- sxx <br>`1/n * (sum((x - mean(x)) * (x - mean(y))))`
- ### Interpretation
- With a positive linear relationship between 𝑋 and 𝑌, we obtain sxy > 0 (positive covariance)
- With a negative linear relationship between 𝑋 and 𝑌, we obtain sxy < 0 (negative covariance)
- If there is no linear relationship between 𝑋 and 𝑌, then sxy ≈ 0
