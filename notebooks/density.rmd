A random variable X is called continuous, if there exists an integrable function $f: R -> R$ with $f(x) \ge 0$ for all $x in R$ such that for every interval [a,b]:

$$P(a \le X \le b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \; dx$$

The function f is called the (probability) density of X. The set
$T = {x \in R: f(x) > 0}$ is called the support of X resp. f.
