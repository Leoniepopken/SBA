A (discrete) random variable X is called ***binomially distibuted with parameters n and $\pi$*** (for short: ***B(n, $\pi$)-distributed*** or ***X ~ B(n, $\pi$)***, if it has the following [probability mass function](./prop_Massfunction.nb.html):

$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
\binom{n}{x}\pi^x(1-\pi)^{n-x}
,& x = 0, 1, \dots, n\\
0  ,& otherwise
\end{cases} $$

The B(n, $\pi$)-distribution results when, given n [independent](./independenceOfRandomVariables.nb.html) repetitions of a Bernoulli experiment
with $\Omega = {\omega_1, \omega_2} and P(\omega = \omega_1) = \pi$, the number of occurences of the outcome $\omega_1$ is counted.

#### Properties
- [Expected value](./central_tendency.nb.html) and [variance](./prop_distribution_measures.nb.html) of the binomial distribution: $E(X) = n\pi$ and $Var(X) = n\pi(1-\pi)$
- Addition of independent binomially distributed random variables: If $X ~ B(n, \pi)$ and $Y ~ B(m, \pi)$ and X, Y are independent, then the sum X + Y is binomially distributed with parameters n + m and \pi:
$X + Y ~ B(n + m, \pi)$

#### [Likelihood function](./construction_of_estimation_functions.nb.html) for unknown $\pi$
$L(\pi) = \pi^x(1-\pi)^{n-x}$
