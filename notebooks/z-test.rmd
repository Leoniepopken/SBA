title: "Z-test for the expected value"

We consider the following test problems in which a hypothetical expected value $\mu_0$ is compared to the true expected value $\mu$: <br>

(a) $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ versus $H_1: \mu != \mu_0$ (two-tailed test problem) <br>
(b) $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ versus $H_1: \mu < \mu_0$ (left-tailed test problem) <br>
(c) $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ versus $H_1: \mu > \mu_0$ (right-tailed test problem) <br>

#### Test size
$Z = \frac{\overline{X} -\mu_0}{o/\sqrt{n}}$ <br>

#### Decision rules:
The decision, in favor of $H_0$, is made: <br>
(a), if $|z| > z_{1-\alpha/2}$ <br>
(b), if $z < - z_{1-\alpha}$ <br>
(c), if $z > z_{1-\alpha}$ <br>
