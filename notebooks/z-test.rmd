We consider the following test problems in which a hypothetical expected value $\mu_0$ is compared to the true expected value $\mu$:

(1) $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ versus $H_1: \mu != \mu_0$ (two-tailed test problem)
(2) $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ versus $H_1: \mu < \mu_0$ (left-tailed test problem)
(3) $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ versus $H_1: \mu > \mu_0$ (right-tailed test problem)
