### Mode
- A simple central tendency that can be used for all scale levels
- The mode indicates which expression occurs most frequently
- If the absolute (or relative) frequency distribution has a unique maximum, the mode is unique and is
denoted by x(mod)
- In the bar chart, the mode is the expression with the highest column
- the mode does not always have to be unique
- If only very few values of the list of observations match the mode is not very meaningful

- compute the mode in R:
`Mode <- function(x) { ux <- unique(x) ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x, ux)))] } mode <- Mode(x)`
