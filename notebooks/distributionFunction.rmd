- If the discrete random variable X is at least ordinally scaled, we can define the distribution function of X similarly to the empirical distribution function of a feature/characteristic
- For this, we assume that the values $x_1, x_2, ... , x_k, ...$ in the support of X are already sorted in ascending
order (i.e. $x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_k < ...$)

$$F(x) = P(X \le x) = \sum\limits_{i:x_i \le x} f(x_i) = \sum\limits_{i:x_i \le x} p_i$$

- F(x) corresponds exactly to the probability that the value of the random variable X is at most x.

#### Properties
- The function F is a monotonically increasing step function
- Jump of height $p_i = f(x_i)$ at $x_i$
- At jump points, the upper value ("stair edge") is the corresponding function value
- F(x) = 0 for all $x < x_1$
