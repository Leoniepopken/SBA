- calculation of least squares estimator <br>
`b <- (sum(x*y) - n*mean(y)*mean(x)) / (sum(x*x) - n*mean(x)*mean(x))` <br>
`a <- mean(y) - b*mean(x)`
- predicted value of Y for any value of X <br> `a + b * x`
- total dispersion of yi
- SQT <br> `sum((y - mean(y)) * (y - mean(y)))`
- SQE <br> `sum((Y - mean(y)) * (Y - mean(y)))`
- SQR <br>`sum((y - Y) * (y - Y))`
- coefficient of determination R² as a measure for the quality of the model <br>`SQE / SQT`
- Alternative Formula <br>`1 - (SQR / SQT)`
- ### Properties of the coefficient of determination
R² = 0 explained dispersion zero -> regression model is extremely bad
R² = 1 explained dispersion = total dispersion -> regression model is perfectly fitted to data
