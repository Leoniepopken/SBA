- the function H(x) = (number of values xi <= x) is called the absolute cumulative frequency distribution of the variable X.
    - it holds: `sum(x <= X)` if x is an vector of realizations of X
- The resulting function F(x) = H(x)/n = (proportion of values xi with xi â‰¤ x) is called the relative cumulative frequency distribution or also the empirical distribution function of the variable X.
    - it holds: `sum(f <= F)` if f is an vector of relative frequencies of x
