- results from the modeling of durations where time is measured - at least approximately - continuously

#### Example:
Lifetime of a product or technical system

#### Condition
Remaining duration is not dependent on the time already elapsed (Probability of failure of the product / technical system independent of its age)

#### [Density](./density)

$$f(x) = \begin{cases}
\lambda e^{-\lambda x} ,& x \ge 0\\
0  ,& x < 0
\end{cases} $$

#### [Distribution Function](./distributionFunction.nb.html)
$$F(x) = \begin{cases}
 1- e^{-\lambda x} ,& x \ge 0\\
0  ,& x < 0
\end{cases} $$

#### Expected value
$E(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda}$

#### Related R commands
`pexp(x, rate)` gives the exponential distribution with parameters x and $\lambda$

Example: Compute the probability $P (X \le 9)$ with x = 9 and $\lambda$ = 3
```{R}
pexp(9, 3)
```
