### Variance and Standard Deviation
- empirical variance s squared = `(1/n) * sum((x - mean(x)) * (x - mean(x)))`
- empirical standard deviation s = `sqrt((1/n) * sum((x - mean(x)) * (x - mean(x))))`
- sample variance = `(1/(n-1)) * sum((x - mean(x)) * (x - mean(x)))`

#### Properties of Variance and Standard Deviation
- senstive with respect to outliers
- Variance and standard deviation do not set the dispersion in relation to the location of the data
- With larger (average) values usually also variance and standard deviation are larger

### Coefficient of Variation
- more suitable for dispersion comparison of distributions with very different (average) values
- calculation in R: `(sqrt((1/n) * sum((x - mean(x)) * (x - mean(x))))) / mean(x)`
