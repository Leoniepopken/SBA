Two discrete random variables X and Y with support $T_X = {x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k, \dots }$ and
$T_Y = {y_1, y_2, \dots, y_k, \dots }$ are called (stochastically) independent if for every x_i \in T_X and every Y_i \in T_Y:

$$P(X = x_i, Y = y_i) = P(X = x_i) * P(Y= y_i$$

- Hence: X and Y are independent if all pairs of events ${X = x_i}$ and ${Y = y_i}$ are independent

<br>
More generally: <br>
If the discrete random variables X and Y are independent, then for any sets $M_1, M_2 \in R$ the events ${X \in M_1} and {Y \in M_2}$ are also independent, i.e. it holds that $P(X \in M_1, Y \in M_2) = P(X \in M_1) * P(Y \in M_2)$
